            Decision
          </h3>
          <p>
            When I was about 13 years old, youtube recommended me a video of a
            girl, talking about her exchange semester. She seemed incredible
            happy for experiencing such a cool time and made me crave that too.
            Within the next few weeks I&apos;ve seen more and more videos of
            teens sharing their memories - mostly positive. Surprisingly one
            day, my math teacher was talking about a carrier event that would
            take place in our school the very next weekend. My dad and I went
            there and soon found out about Education First (short EF), an
            organization that specializes in exchange years and language trips.
            We gave them our contact details and almost forgot about it. But
            then, 2 years later they CALLED us - &quot;Is Markus still
            interested in an exchange semester?&quot; - Hell yeah I was!

            Preperations
          </h3>
          <p>
            Around one year before going abroad, the preperations started. There
            was a crazy amount of documents and forms I had to fill out. The day
            I&apos;d cross the ocean and explore a new continent, at least
            that&apos;s what it felt like, was coming closer and closer. Until
            one day, &apos;bout eight exhausting month later, I sat at home,
            looking at my packed up suitcase, being absolutely ready for the
            best time of my life.
            <br />
            The next day, I got a message from my hostdad Ben &apos;Hope you got
            some sleep&apos; - not at all HAHA - no sleep for me.

          <p>
            My host family wasn&apos;t particularly big. As EF said, they come
            in &apos;all shapes and sizes&apos;. But that doesn&apos;t change
            the fact, that I had the best semester one could wish for. Ben and
            Fred, my hostbrother from Denmark who&apos;s exchange year I joined
            in the second semester where the best host family I could have
            imagined. We had a great time and built so many memories together.
