      "On December 13<sup>th</sup> I stepped onto a plane, headed to Chicago, United States. With only 16 years of age, I was on my way into a completely different life, meeting people from another culture and staying there for a whole semester. Now that it's all over, I can comfortably say that it was the best decision I ever made. I built so many friendships, still being close with some of them. And of course, my ability and my skills with the english language skyrocketed. I not only created lasting memories, but also improved as a person. I am sooo thankful for the time I spent there and all the opportunities that came up for me. Experiencing american culture was truly fascinating.<br /><br />Thank you Ben, Fred, Skyler, Marifer, Jefferson, Ashton, Derek, Christian, and all of you. You made my time in the USA great!<br /><br /><a href='/journeys/exchange' class='underline decoration-[0.2rem] underline-offset-4'>See more!</a>",
